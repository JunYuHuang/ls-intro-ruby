# Prompt

Write a method that takes a string as an argument. The method should return a new, all-caps version of the string, only if the string is longer than 10 characters. Example: change "hello world" to "HELLO WORLD". (Hint: Ruby's String class has a few methods that would be helpful. Check the [Ruby Docs!](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/String.html))
