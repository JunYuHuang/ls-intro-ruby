# Chapter 8: Arrays

## Notes

- array: ordered and 0-indexed item list
  - can hold any and unlike types together (like JavaScript arrays)
  - access by index with bracket syntax `[]`
- change arrays
  - `#pop` method
  - `#push` or `#<<` method
  - `#map` or `#collect` method
  - `#delete_at` method
  - `#delete` method
  - `#uniq` method
  - `#uniq!` method
  - `#unshift` method: `#push` but to array's start
- loop over arrays
  - `#each` method
  - `#select` method
    - like JavaScript's `Array.prototype.filter()` method
- `!`-suffixed methods
  - usually means it mutates the caller but not always
- mutating the caller and arguments
- nested arrays
- compare arrays with `==` operator
- `#to_s` method
- common array methods
  - `#include?` method
  - `#flatten` method
  - `#each_index` method
  - `#each_with_index` method
  - `#sort` method
  - `#product` method
- `#each` vs `#map`
  - same: both loop thru a list
  - `each`:
    - mutates the list
    - if passed block, returns list else an `Enumerator` object
    - use to loop
  - `map`:
    - does not mutate the list
    - returns a new array that holds the block-returned values
    - use to transform
- misc
  - pure vs impure methods
    - impure method: mutates or changes the caller
    - pure method: leaves the caller & returns a copy of it
- summary
  - arrays are very useful and widely used
  - Ruby's `Array` class has many built-in helper methods
