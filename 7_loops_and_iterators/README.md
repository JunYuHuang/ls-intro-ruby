# Chapter 7: Loops & Iterators

## Notes

- loop: keeps running a code piece until a condition is met
- `loop` method:
  - like infinite loop
  - makes new scope
- loop controls
  - `break` and `next` keywords
- `while` loop: keeps running while condition is true
  - use `while` keyword to create it
  - `until` loops are the reverse of `while` loops i.e. `!while`
  - no new scope
- `do-while` loop: `while` loop but always runs 1+ times
  - use `loop` method with `break` keyword
  - not recommended: use `begin...end` + `while` statement
  - makes new scope
- `for` loop: loops over an item list
  - use `for` keyword with some list
  - valid lists: range, array
  - returns the list
  - no new scope
- can add conditionals in loops
- iterator: methods that loop over an item list
  - e.g. `Array.each()` method
  - block: to-be run code piece
    - use `{}` or `do...end` syntax to close a block
- recursion: loop by calling a method in itself
  - works via the call stack under the hood
  - idea: base case that returns + recursive case(s)
- misc
  - `.` dot operator
  - range is a special type
  - Ruby convention: prefer iterators over loops
  - blocks create their own scope; keywords do not
    - a `{...}` or `do...end` that follows a method call is a block
- summary
  - loops
  - iterators
  - recursion
