# Prompt

Given a hash of family members, with keys as the title and an array of names as the values, use Ruby's built-in [select method](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Hash.html#method-i-select) to gather only siblings' names into a new array.

```ruby
family = {
  uncles: ["bob", "joe", "steve"],
  sisters: ["jane", "jill", "beth"],
  brothers: ["frank", "rob", "david"],
  aunts: ["mary", "sally", "susan"]
}
```

# My Solution
